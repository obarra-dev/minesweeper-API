## Notes

In order to use the programming language and frameworks discussed during the interview I decided to use Thymeleaf/Java to develop the front-end. So my goal is to use Golang and Java to build the solution.

However, Thymleaf/Java is not the best choice to develop the front-end for this game. 

In order to deliver a neater solution, I decided to use a single repository to store the development project. 

Last but not least I thank you in advance for this opportunity. I really enjoyed the challenge.
