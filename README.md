##  List of items completed

* Design and implement a documented RESTful API for the game (think of a mobile app for your API)
* Implement an API client library for the API designed above. Ideally, in a different language, of your preference, to the one used for the API
* When a cell with no adjacent mines is revealed, all adjacent squares will be revealed (and repeat)
* Ability to 'flag' a cell with a question mark or red flag
* Detect when game is over


## Notes

In order to use the programming language and frameworks discussed during the interview I decided to use Thymeleaf/Java to develop the front-end. So my goal is to use Golang and Java to build the solution.

However, Thymleaf/Java is not the best choice to develop the front-end for this game. 

In order to deliver a neater solution, I decided to use a single repository to store the development project. 

Last but not least I thank you in advance for this opportunity. I really enjoyed the challenge.
